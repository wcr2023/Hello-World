        HTML is a programming language primarily used for webpage desiging.
        It consists of elements that describe the arrangement of the webpage.
        Web browsers read this text and use it to display a page.

        I chose to take this class because I had some prior experience
        with similar coding things from Khan academy a while ago and I 
        wanted to try learning more about it.  I originally wasn't going 
        to take this, but another pseo class that I wanted to take a little 
        more fell through and this was my backup.
